title: Junior Data Engineer
description: **Junior DE** is an LLM App for data analysts, engineers and scientists to offload the daily, mundane data tasks. It can:
---

- Write python scripts for processing data, creating charts
- Analyze CSV, Parquet or JSON data using DuckDb.
- Write complex queries including joins and filtering.
- Run data transformations and export the results.
- Explain analysis step-by-step.

The best part is that it inspects, validates and runs the code like a regular engineer. It also plays well with long-term, multi-turn conversations. Follow along to run your own Junior DE:

<Note>

Install <LinkOpenNewTab href="https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/" text="docker desktop" /> to run this app locally.

</Note>

## Setup

Open the `Terminal` and create an `ai` directory with a python virtual environment.

<CodeGroup>

```bash Mac
mkdir ai && cd ai

python3 -m venv aienv
source aienv/bin/activate
```

```bash Windows
mkdir ai; cd ai

python3 -m venv aienv
aienv/scripts/activate
```

</CodeGroup>

Install `phidata`

<CodeGroup>

```bash Mac
pip install -U phidata
```

```bash Windows
pip install -U phidata
```

</CodeGroup>

<Note>

If you encounter errors, update pip using `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`

</Note>

## Create your codebase

Create your codebase using the `junior-de` template.

<CodeGroup>

```bash Mac
phi ws create -t junior-de -n junior-de
```

```bash Windows
phi ws create -t junior-de -n junior-de
```

</CodeGroup>

This will create a folder named `junior-de` with the following structure:

```bash junior-de
junior-de                   # root directory for your Junior DE
├── app                     # directory for Streamlit apps
├── duckgpt                 # directory for the DuckDb data engineer
├── pygpt                   # directory for the Python data engineer
├── notebooks               # directory for Jupyter notebooks
├── data                    # directory for local data files
├── Dockerfile              # Dockerfile for the application
├── pyproject.toml          # python project definition
├── requirements.txt        # python dependencies managed by pyproject.toml
├── scripts                 # directory for helper scripts
├── utils                   # directory for utilities
└── workspace               # phidata workspace directory
    ├── dev_resources.py    # dev resources running locally
    ├── prd_resources.py    # production resources running on AWS
    ├── jupyter             # jupyter notebook resources
    ├── secrets             # directory for storing secrets
    └── settings.py         # phidata workspace settings
```

### Optional: Set OpenAI Api Key

To use your own `OPENAI_API_KEY`, set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable. You can get one <LinkOpenNewTab href="https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys" text="from OpenAI here" />. Otherwise `phi` provides ready to use access to OpenAI models.

<CodeGroup>

```bash Mac
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-***
```

```bash Windows
setx OPENAI_API_KEY sk-***
```

</CodeGroup>

## Run Junior DE locally

Start your Junior DE using:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Terminal
phi ws up
```

```bash Shorthand
phi ws up dev:docker
```

</CodeGroup>

**Press Enter** to confirm and give a few minutes for the image to download (only the first time). Verify container status and view logs on the docker dashboard.

## PyGPT: Automate Data Analysis using Python

- Open <LinkOpenNewTab href="http://localhost:8501" text="localhost:8501" /> to access your Junior DE.
- Your first Junior DE is **PyGPT**, it can write python scripts for processing data, create charts and more. Click on **PyGPT** and enter a username.
- Ask "Show me revenue per year"
- Each script that PyGPT created is saved to the `pygpt/op` folder.
- See your Junior DE work through the problem.

<ImageContainer src="/images/pygpt_local.jpeg" alt="Junior DE: PyGPT Local" />

## Add your data

The data used by `PyGPT` is defined in the `pygpt/csv_files.py` file.

- Add `csv` files to the `data/` folder and then to the `csv_files` list.
- The more information we can provide about the file, the better the results.

## How PyGPT works

The `Conversation` powering `PyGPT` is defined in the `llm/conversations/pygpt.py` file. You can customize the prompts and adapt the Junior DE to your workflow.

```python llm/conversations/pygpt.py
...
    return Conversation(
        ...
        agents=[python_agent],;
        system_prompt=f"""\
        You are a Data Engineering assistant designed to perform tasks using Python.
        ...
    )
...
```

The `PythonAgent()` defined in the `llm/agents/python_agent.py` file provides the `Tools` used by GPT-4.

## DuckGPT: Automate Data Analysis using DuckDb

- Your second Junior DE is **DuckGPT** that can write and run SQL queries using DuckDb.
- Click on **DuckGPT Local** and enter a username.
- Ask "Show me revenue over time"
- See your Junior DE work through the problem.
- Ask "Save it" to save the query to the `/duckgpt/op` folder.

<ImageContainer
  src="/images/duckdb_de_local.jpeg"
  alt="Junior DE: DuckGPT Local"
/>

## Add your data

The data used by local `DuckGPT` is defined in the `duckgpt/local_tables.py` file.

- Add `csv` files to the `data/` folder and then to the `local_tables` list.
- These tables are created using a `CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE '{name}' AS SELECT * FROM '{path}';` command so can accept any file type supported by DuckDb.
- You can also define custom data loading operations in the `load_local_tables()` function and click on the **Load All Tables** button to load the DuckDb database manually.

## How DuckGPT works

The `Conversation` powering `DuckGPT` is defined in the `llm/conversations/duckgpt_local.py` file. You can customize the prompts and adapt the Junior DE to your workflow.

```python llm/conversations/duckgpt_local.py
...
    return Conversation(
        ...
        agents=[duckdb_local_agent],;
        system_prompt=f"""\
        You are a Data Engineering assistant designed to answer questions using DuckDb.
        ...
    )
...
```

The `DuckDbAgent()` defined in the `llm/agents/duckdb_agent.py` file provides the `Tools` used by GPT-4.

## DuckGPT on S3 data

- Click on **DuckGPT S3** and enter a username.
- Ask "Which actor has the highest average movie rating? ignore those with under 25 moviees and total 1000000 votes."
- See your Junior DE work through a complex problem.

<Note>

The first query takes a few minutes as a lot of data from s3 is loaded into memory. You can pre-load data using the `Load All Tables` button or use your own (smaller) datasets.

</Note>

<ImageContainer
  src="/images/junior-de-duckgpt-s3.png"
  alt="Junior DE: DuckGPT S3"
/>

## Add S3 data

The tables used by S3 `DuckGPT` are defined in the `duckgpt/s3_tables.py` file.

- Add your S3 `tables` and the `relationships` between them. These aren't necessary but help improve the responses of the LLM.
- These tables are created using a `CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE '{name}' AS SELECT * FROM '{path}';` command so can accept any file type supported by DuckDb.
- You can also define custom data loading operations in the `load_s3_tables()` function and click on the **Load All Tables** button to load the DuckDb database manually.

## Optional: Run Jupyterlab

A jupyter notebook is a must have for AI development and your `junior-de` comes with a notebook pre-installed with the required dependencies. Enable it by updating the `workspace/settings.py` file:

```python workspace/settings.py
...
ws_settings = WorkspaceSettings(
    ...
    # Uncomment the following line
    dev_jupyter_enabled=True,
)
...
```

Start `jupyter` using:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Terminal
phi ws up --group lab
```

```bash Shorthand
phi ws up dev:docker:lab
```

</CodeGroup>

**Press Enter** to confirm and give a few minutes for the image to download (only the first time). Verify container status and view logs on the docker dashboard.

### View Jupyterlab UI

- Open <LinkOpenNewTab href="http://localhost:8888" text="localhost:8888" /> to view the Jupyterlab UI. Password: **admin**
- Open `notebooks/local_duckgpt` to run DuckGPT on local data.

<ImageContainer
  src="/images/junior-de-jupyter-local.png"
  alt="junior-de-jupyter-local"
/>

## Delete local resources

Play around and stop the workspace using:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Terminal
phi ws down
```

```bash With Options
phi ws down --env dev --infra docker
```

```bash Shorthand
phi ws down dev:docker
```

</CodeGroup>

or stop individual Apps using:

<CodeGroup>

```bash App
phi ws down --group app
```

```bash PgVector
phi ws down --group db
```

```bash Jupyter
phi ws down --group jupyter
```

</CodeGroup>

## Run on AWS

Now let's run the **Junior DE** in production on AWS.

## AWS Authentication

To run on AWS, you need **one** of the following:

1. The `~/.aws/credentials` file with your AWS credentials
2. `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` + `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables

<Note>

To create the credentials file, install the <LinkOpenNewTab href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html" text="aws cli" /> and run `aws configure`

</Note>

### Add AWS Region and Subnets

Add 2 <LinkOpenNewTab href="https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home?#subnets:" text="Subnets" /> to the `workspace/settings.py` file, these are required for the ECS services.

```python workspace/settings.py
ws_settings = WorkspaceSettings(
    ...
    # -*- AWS settings
    # Add your Subnet IDs here
    subnet_ids=["subnet-xyz", "subnet-xyz"],
    ...
)
```

<Note>

Please check that the subnets belong to the selected `aws_region`

</Note>

## Update Secrets

Update the Junior DE password in the `workspace/secrets/prd_app_secrets.yml` file:

```python workspace/secrets/prd_app_secrets.yml
APP_PASSWORD: "admin"
# OPENAI_API_KEY: "sk-***"
```

Update the RDS database password in the `workspace/secrets/prd_db_secrets.yml` file:

```python workspace/secrets/prd_db_secrets.yml
# Secrets used by prd RDS database
MASTER_USERNAME: llm
MASTER_USER_PASSWORD: "llm9999!!"
```

## Create AWS resources

Create AWS resources for the LLM App using:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Terminal
phi ws up --env prd --infra aws
```

```bash Shorthand
phi ws up prd:aws
```

</CodeGroup>

This will create:

1. [ECS Cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/clusters.html) for the application.
2. [ECS Task Definitions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definitions.html) and [Services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html) that run the application on the ECS cluster.
3. [LoadBalancer](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/) to route traffic to the application.
4. [Security Groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-security-groups.html) that control incoming and outgoing traffic.
5. [Secrets](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/) for managing application and database secrets.
6. [RDS Database](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/) for Knowledge Base and Storage.

**Press Enter** to confirm and grab a cup of coffee while the resources spin up.

- The RDS database takes about 10 minutes to activate.
- These resources are defined in the `workspace/prd_resources.py` file.
- Use the [ECS console](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/v2/clusters) to view services and logs.
