1. Create a new <LinkOpenNewTab href="https://github.com/new" text="git respository" />.

2. Push your code to the git repository.

```bash Terminal
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Init LLM App"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/[YOUR_GIT_REPO].git
git push -u origin main
```

3. Your team can then follow the [setup steps for new users](/day-2/new-users) to use this workspace.
