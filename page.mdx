title: Introduction
description: Phidata is an AI toolkit designed to run LLM Apps with 1 command 
---

It provides production-ready templates for common AI Apps that you can run locally or on AWS.

## üöÄ How it works

- Create your codebase using a template: `phi ws create`
- Run your app locally: `phi ws up dev:docker`
- Run your app on AWS: `phi ws up prd:aws`

## ‚≠ê Features:

- **Powerful:** Get a production-ready AI App with 1 command.
- **Simple:** Built using a human-like `Conversation` interface to language models.
- **Production Ready:** Your app can be deployed to aws with 1 command.

For example, run a RAG LLM App built with FastApi, Streamlit and PgVector:

![](/gifs/phi_llm_app.gif)

Quickstart your AI App using one of these examples:

Under the hood, phidata solves the problem of building LLM products by providing:

### Software layer

- Access to **LLMs** using a human-like `Conversation` interface
- Strategies for improving LLM responses: **RAG, Tasks, Structured Outputs, Validators**
- Building blocks for LLM apps: **Agents, Assistants, Knowledge Bases, Storage, Memory**
- Monitoring for LLM apps: **Model Inputs/Outputs, Quality, Cost, Evals**

### Application layer

- Tools for serving LLM apps: **FastApi, Django, Streamlit**
- Tools for serving LLM components: **PgVector, Postgres, Redis**

### Infrastructure layer

- Infrastructure for running LLM apps locally: **Docker**
- Infrastructure for running LLM apps in production: **AWS**
- Best practices like testing, formatting, CI/CD, security and secret management.

Most LLM apps are built as a house of cards because engineers have to stitch each layer manually. Phidata bridges the 3 layers of software development to deliver production-grade LLM Apps.
