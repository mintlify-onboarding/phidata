title: Day 2 Operations
---
In software engineering, **Day 2** is when the work begins.

- **Day 0**: Run the application locally for development.
- **Day 1**: Run the application in production.
- **Day 2**: Improve, update and maintain the application as a team.

**Day-2** is the hardest part of software engineering and phidata templates are designed with best practices to make Day 2 easy. Go over the following as needed:

- [Create a Git Repository](/day-2/git-repo/page)
- [Setup workspace for new users](/day-2/new-users/page)
- [Update the Development Application](/day-2/dev-app/page)
- [Update the Production Application](/day-2/production-app/page)
- [Manage Python Libraries](/day-2/python-libraries/page)
- [Secret Management](/day-2/secrets/page)
- [Environment Variables](/day-2/env-vars/page)
- [Formatting & Validatation](/day-2/format-and-validate/page)
