title: Building Blocks
description: Phidata is an AI toolkit designed to run LLM Apps with 1 command.
---

To achieve this, phidata provides a powerful set of building blocks to connect the Software, Application and Infratructure layers:

- [Conversations](/blocks/conversations/page) are a human-like interface to LLMs and how we program LLMs.
- [Assistants](/blocks/assistants/page) are a user-friendly interface to the OpenAI Assistants API.
- [Tasks](/blocks/tasks/page) are singular operations that are used in Conversations to build a LLM workflow.
- [Knowledge Bases](/blocks/knowledge-base/page) are information databases used by LLMs to improve their responses.
- [Storage](/blocks/storage/page) enables us to store conversations in a database and provide long-term memory.
- [Memory](/blocks/memory/page) stores the user/llm interactions during a conversation.
- [Agents](/blocks/agents/page) are a collection of functions that LLMs can run to achieve tasks. They make the conversations Autonomous.
- [LLMs](/blocks/llms/page) are machine-learning models that have been trained to understand natural language and code. They are quickly emerging as the building block of a new computing paradigm.
- [Apps](/blocks/apps/page) are applications like `FastApi`, `PgVector`, `Streamlit`, `Django` used to run software. They provide the application layer to server/run our LLM App.
- [Resources](/blocks/resources/page) are infrastructure components that help us run the applications locally or on AWS. Eg: docker container, ECS task, RDS database etc..
- [Workspace](/blocks/workspaces/page) is the codebase for our LLM App.
